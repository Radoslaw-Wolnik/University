To those woodland hillocks, to those meadows, green and gleaming,
Invocation
Thus, by a miracle, You will bring us home,
The Nowogródek castle and protect its faithful people,
Upon which, quiet pear trees spread in few flocks.
To those fields with various grain painted,
With wheat gilded, and with rye silvered;
And soon, I could walk to Your temple’s threshold,
Today, all your beauty and sublimity I view,
Meanwhile, please, bear my yearning soul,
Once healed me, a sick child, by a miracle!
O Lithuania ! My homeland! You are as good health,
by Adam Mickiewicz
O Holy Virgin , who shelters our bright Częstochowa,
And, seeing it, I depict it, because I yearn for you!
Spread wide along each side of the blue-flowing Niemen,
And all as if girded with a ribbon made of green balks,
Where the amber mustard, buckwheat white as snow,
Where clover flowers with maidenly blushes grow,
My dead eyelid opened again without dying,
Only the one who lost you can judge his former wealth,
(When my mother gave me under Your care crying,
And shines in Ostra Brama! You, who look around,
To thank God for the life that now I can hold);
